## Overview
This is a fun webscraping project to see if Vegas betting lines on football are optimized. Concensus betting lines are 
tuned to aim for 50% of the money on each side of a line. This is influenced by public betting, which can often be irrational.
To see if there is an edge to be gained, I compared vegas lines from [vegasinsider](https://www.vegasinsider.com) to 
[fivethirtyeight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com)'s ELO ratings. ELO ratings calculate the expected spread for a game and
are not influenced by the public. Is there an edge to be gained?
